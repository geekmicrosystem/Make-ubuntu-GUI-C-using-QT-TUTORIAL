Qt (pronounced "cute") is a free and open-source widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform 
applications that run on various software and hardware platforms 
such as Linux, Windows, macOS, Android or embedded systems with little or no change in the underlying codebase 
while still being a native application with native capabilities and speed.

Qt is currently being developed by The Qt Company, a publicly listed company, and the Qt Project under open-source governance, involving individual developers and organizations working to advance Qt.[10][11][12] Qt is available under both commercial licenses[4] and open-source[13] GPL 2.0, GPL 3.0, and LGPL

Qt is used for developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and multi-platform applications
that run on all major desktop platforms and most mobile or embedded platforms. Most GUI programs created with 
Qt have a native-looking interface, in which case Qt is classified as a widget toolkit. Also non-GUI programs can be developed, 
such as command-line tools and consoles for servers. An example of such a non-GUI program using Qt is the Cutelyst web framework.

Qt supports various compilers, including the GCC C++ compiler and the Visual Studio suite and has extensive internationalization support. 
Qt also provides Qt Quick, that includes a declarative scripting language called QML that allows using JavaScript to provide the logic. With Qt Quick, 
rapid application development for mobile devices became possible, while logic can still be written with native code as well to achieve the best possible performance.

Other features include SQL database access, XML parsing, JSON parsing, thread management and network support.
